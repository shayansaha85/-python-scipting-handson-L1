**1. Implement the function ruler() which takes a number (for example, 43) as argument, and produces output as shown below.**
<br>
```         1         2         3         4```
<br>
```1234567890123456789012345678901234567890123```
<br>
(note: 1st row values are aligned to respective 0s of the 2nd row)
<br>
Test correctness of the function with the following values :
<br>
5, 10, 25, 51 and 80
<br>
**2. Implement the function isWhiteLine(), which takes a string and returns TRUE if the string contains only white space & tab characters. Making use of the above function, write a program, which should read a file given as command-line argument, and print only non-blank lines onto the standard output.**
<br>
**3. Implement the function isListOfInts(), which takes a list, and checks if the list has only "int" type values, as per the specification given below:**
<br>
  • The function should return True, if the list has only "int" type values, otherwise should return False.
<br>
  • The function should return True, if an empty list is passed as argument.
<br>
  • If the argument is not of ‘list’ type, then the function should throw ValueError exception, with the error message 'arg not of <list> type'
<br>
  • The function should have only one return statement.
